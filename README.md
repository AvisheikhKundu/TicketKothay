# TicketKothay


### Introduction
The public transportation sector in Bangladesh faces challenges in providing travelers with a unified and 
seamless platform for booking bus tickets. Currently, passengers need to visit individual bus companies’ 
offices or websites, which is time-consuming and inconvenient. Additionally, there is often a lack of 
transparency regarding seat availability and pricing, leading to inefficiencies in planning trips. 
 
#### Problem Statement: 
With the increasing demand for accessible and streamlined digital services, the absence of a centralized 
bus ticket booking system creates a gap in the market. 
Users face: 
• Difficulty comparing ticket prices across different companies. 
• Inefficiency in booking tickets due to the need to use multiple platforms. 
• Lack of real-time availability updates and booking confirmation. 
 
#### Objective: 
TicketKothay was developed as a unified platform that allows users to purchase bus tickets from 
multiple companies efficiently. By leveraging the C programming language, the application provides a 
reliable and user-friendly system for booking tickets, ensuring convenience and transparency for 
travelers. 
 
### Motivation 
 The advancement of digital solutions has transformed many industries, yet the public transportation 
sector, particularly bus ticket booking, remains fragmented in Bangladesh. Leveraging the power of 
computational tools and programming, I was motivated to design an application that can simplify this 
process by unifying multiple ticket providers under one platform. The challenge of managing multiple 
data streams, real-time updates, and user-friendly interfaces using the C programming language 
presented an exciting opportunity to develop a robust and efficient solution.
